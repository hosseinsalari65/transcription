# transcription
Using these Python Notebooks you will be able to compute Pileup meta-gene analysis (PMGA) on intra- and inter-gene contact maps as well as intra-gene ChIP-seq profiles. These code have been used in H. Salari, G. Fourel, and D. Jost. "Transcription regulates the spatio-temporal dynamics of genes through micro-compartmentalization." bioRxiv (2023): 2023-07.
